/*
Approach:
We are given a 2D board containing 'X' (battleship part) and '.' (empty water).
Each battleship is made up of contiguous 'X's aligned either horizontally or vertically â€” no diagonals.
The goal is to count how many **distinct battleships** are on the board.

We use DFS to explore each group of connected 'X's and mark them as visited (by turning them into '.').
Each DFS traversal from an unvisited 'X' represents one full battleship.

Time Complexity: O(m * n)
- We visit each cell once at most.

Space Complexity: O(m * n) (worst-case recursion stack for DFS)
